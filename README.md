# 🎉 PLP-PYTHON: Rodah-chep's Learning Playground 🎉

Welcome to my personal Python playground for the Power Learn Project (PLP) Software Development Course!  
This repo is where I experiment, learn, and sometimes break things (on purpose—it's all part of the process 😄).

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This is a living collection of bite-sized Python projects and assignments. Every file is a step in my coding journey, and each script has its own little story!

### 📄 File Highlights

- `Python Introduction.py`  
  My very first Python script here! It’s a basic calculator that asks for two numbers and prints their sum. Simple, but it’s where every coder begins (and yes, I still get excited seeing “The sum is…” pop up).

## 🌟 About This Repo

- **Personal & Playful:**  
  This is my safe space to try, fail, and grow. If you see messy code, random comments, or weird file names, that's just me having fun!
- **PLP Connection:**  
  Built while attending the Power Learn Project scholarship—an awesome pan-African initiative helping future devs (like me!) level up.
